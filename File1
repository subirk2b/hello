Scrum Team Issues
1. Quality Tools adoption issue because of lack of awareness
2. Backlog is not in detail...creating problem at the time of estimation and planning
3. Architect is 100% involved in development...not able to give time for R&D, Review code
4. Reviewing is doing by peer team member...not by a expert in CASM team
5. Lack of Training...training must be arranged before starting the project
